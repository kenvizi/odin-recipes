# odin-recipes
The Odin Project Recipes Project

In this project our goal is to build a basic recipe website.

After we're done with this project we would be able to demonstrate our mastery with HTML basics (elements and tags, html boilerplate, text editing, lists, links and images, proper commit messages for git).
