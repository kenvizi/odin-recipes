    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Popcorn chicken is a dish of bite-sized chunks of deep-fried chicken that are sure to be a family favorite. I love to serve the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice </li>
        <li>oil for frying </li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.</li>
        <li>Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
